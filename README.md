Introduction

This monograph is a collection of recipes for creating state-space models in R.
I like the power of state-space models, and R had several excellent packages for building them.
Unfortunately, it’s not quite an “out of the box” technology.
Using any package involves numerous little details, and unless I used the package very recently,
building a model requires pulling out the package documentation,
reading it all over again, and trying to remember how the parts fit together.
One day I got tired of that, so I put together these recipes.
